## Information about the iMac computers in the lab

If you want to update the software on the iMac Computers, you have to first check the compatibility with the version number. 

You can go to The Apple icon in the top left corner > About This Mac 

The model number will tell you when the iMac was released and the version number will tell you what version of OS your computer is running. 

If the computer is running software 10.7 or below, you will have to go online and download and install the next version of software yourself (rather than through the App Store). 

To download El Capitan follow the instructions [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206886).

To download High Sierra follow the instructions [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208969).

<b> Note: if the iMac is version 11,2 (i.e. mid 2010) or earlier, the highest OS you can upgrade to is High Sierra </b>
