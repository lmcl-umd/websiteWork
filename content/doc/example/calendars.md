### Overview:

Our lab uses and maintains three Google Calendars to books and schedule the three rooms in BPS 3150.

Those three calendars are:

<li>LMCL 3150A</li>
<li>LMCL 3150B</li>
<li>LMCL 3150G</li>

To gain access to the calendars, ask Dr, Slevc to share them with your given gmail account. Once you have access, you can reserve the desired room by simply adding an event with your name as the subject from the time you need in the desired room's calendar.
