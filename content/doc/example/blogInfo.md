The LMCL now maintains a blog, hosted by Medium. If you're enrolled in PSYC 479, one option for your 'final paper' is to contribute a blog post about some topic related to language and/or music cognition that you find interesting. 

The blog can be found at our lab [publication section](https://medium.com/langmuscoglab) on Medium.

Ideally, these posts should:

1. describe the findings of a recent primary source article about music perception/cognition (ideally referring to additional relevant sources as well). 
2. target an intelligent, but non-expert, audience. Consider the advice [here](https://www.americanscientist.org/blog/from-the-staff/12-tips-for-scientists-writing-for-the-general-public), for example.

You could find recent interesting and relevant work in lots of ways. If you have a topic in mind, try [google scholar](http://scholar.google.com/) (I suggest you constrain your search to the last year or two). If you have an older paper you're interested in, try a cited reference search (click "Cited by..." under the google scholar result for that paper) to see if there's some newer relevant research that you could include. And if you don't yet have a topic in mind, try browsing recent tables of contents from some journals that publish relevant research -- here are some suggestions (though definitely not an exhaustive list - and note that you may need on-campus or proxy access to get some of these journals): 

- [Brain & Language](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/brain-and-language)
- [Cognition](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/cognition)
- [Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/ljoi/jocn)
- [JEP:LMC](https://psycnet.apa.org/PsycARTICLES/journal/xlm/45/11) or [JEP:HPP](https://psycnet.apa.org/PsycARTICLES/journal/xhp/45/11) (note that you'll annoyingly have to dig around [PsycINFO](https://www.lib.umd.edu/dbfinder/id/UMD01529) to get access to these articles)
- [Language, Cognition and Neuroscience](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/plcp21/current)
- [Neuropsychologia](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/neuropsychologia)
- [Psychological Science](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/pss)
- [Psychology of Music](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/pom)
- [Psychonomic Bulletin & Review](https://www.psychonomic.org/page/PBR)

Here's some basic info on [writing a post in Medium](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/225168768-Write-post), [adding your post to the lab publication](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/213904978-Add-draft-or-post-to-publication), and on [embedding content](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/214981378-Embeds) in your post. (note: please un-check "Allow curators to recommend my story" when you publish.) 

Finally, here are a few examples of (IMHO) good science writing. You should, of course, find your own voice, but these are some good examples of the type of writing we're hoping for:

- [PsychoBabble](https://theamericanscholar.org/daily-scholar/psycho-babble/)
- [Psychonomic Society blog](https://featuredcontent.psychonomic.org/)
- Vicky Williamson's [Music Psychology blog](https://musicpsychology.co.uk/)
- and many more (please send me suggestions if you have 'em!)

Happy writing!
