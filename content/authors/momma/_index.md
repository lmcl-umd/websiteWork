Shota Momma completed his Ph.D. in Linguistics in 2016. He was advised by [Colin Phillips](http://www.colinphillips.net), but also spent a good chunk of time in the LMCL, so we'll take some credit. Shota is currently a postdoc in the [Language Production Lab at UCSD](https://lpl.ucsd.edu) and will soon be an assistant professor of Linguistics at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.
