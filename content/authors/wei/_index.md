I received my PhD degree in psychological sciences at University of Connecticut in 2022 with a concentration of Language and Cognition. My PhD research focused on the dynamics of auditory perception, and how this relates to individual differences in reading measurements.  Prior to that, I received a Master's degree in Music Therapy from New York University. I am also a Board-Certified Music Therapist, and a Licensed Creative Art Therapist. I am interested in how auditory cognition, on its own and in coordination with other cognitive domains, can contribute to our understanding of brain dynamics.
