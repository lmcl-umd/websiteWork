Sofia Villagomez is majoring in biology and minoring in Spanish with the hopes of pursuing a career as a dentist. Part of her family is from Ecuador, so as a bilingual, she is very interested in the real world application and science behind code switching. In her free time she enjoys playing tennis, crocheting, and exploring!
