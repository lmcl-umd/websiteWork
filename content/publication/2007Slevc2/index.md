abstract: Number agreement and grammatical gender agreement are susceptible to attraction, where characteristics of other sentence elements lead to agreement errors. Previous evidence and theories suggest that attraction happens as a syntactic or lexical process (i.e., involving word-knowledge), rather than as a conceptual process (i.e., involving world-knowledge). The current paper presents data on a different type of agreement<b>:</b> agreement in notional/conceptual gender between genitive pronouns and their antecedents. We find that conceptual gender agreement is also susceptible to attraction, but unlike number or grammatical gender agreement, this attraction happens as a conceptual process, not a syntactic/lexical process.
